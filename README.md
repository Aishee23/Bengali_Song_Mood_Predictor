# Bengali_Song_Mood_Predictor

Explore the emotional landscape of Bengali songs with our innovative Bengali Song Mood Predictor. This project, fueled by a passion for artificial intelligence and machine learning, seeks to identify the mood of Bengali songs using advanced technologies and a specially crafted dataset.

## Project Overview
This project was developed in collaboration with Prof. Sudipta Chakrabarty, a distinguished faculty member of the Department of Computer Science and Engineering - Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (CSE-AIML) and Computer Science and Engineering - Data Science (CSE-DS) at Techno Main Salt Lake. Our team embarked on a thrilling journey to create a model capable of predicting the mood of Bengali songs.

## Key Components
Custom Dataset
To ensure high accuracy and relevance, we carefully curated a unique dataset of Bengali songs, each annotated with specific emotions such as joy, melancholy, and more. This handcrafted dataset is the cornerstone of our mood prediction model.

## Python Libraries
Utilizing the robust capabilities of Python, we employed several libraries including Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, TensorFlow, Keras, and Pickle to develop and train our model. These powerful tools enabled us to extract the maximum potential from our project.

## Web Application
To deliver a seamless and intuitive user experience, we developed a local web application where users can easily discover the emotions tied to their favorite Bengali songs. For optimal performance, make sure the system includes the scaler save file (scaler.pkl), the saved model file (my_model), and the dataset file (dataset.csv).

## Unlocking the Potential of Emotion Recognition
The ability to discern the mood of Bengali songs holds significant promise across various sectors, from refining music streaming platforms' recommendations to crafting personalized playlists that resonate with users' emotions. Our project paves the way for exciting new applications in the intersection of artificial intelligence and music appreciation.
